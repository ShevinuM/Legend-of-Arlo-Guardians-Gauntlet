# Legend of Arlo : The Guardian's Gauntlet

## Brief Description and Backstory

In an alternate timeline after The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Link and Lyra have a son named Arlo. As remnants of Ganon begin to stir, Link entrusts the Master Sword to the Guardianâ€™s Gauntlet, leaving a message for Arlo to retrieve it and defeat Ganon. Arlo, now a young adult, embarks on a dangerous journey to claim the sword and fulfill his destiny. Players take on the role of Arlo, navigating puzzles and facing foes in the Gauntlet to reach the Master Sword and then planning the escape. The game culminates in Arlo's daring escape with the sword, determining the fate of Hyrule.
